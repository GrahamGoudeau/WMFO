# WMFO

## Installation
1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager for Mac OS
1. Install Node and NPM with `brew install node`. You may need to change some XCode permissions (you'll be prompted if that's the case)
1. Do something equivalent to `mv server/.dev.env server/.env`, which will set you up with the bare minimum config variables.
1. In the root directory of the repo, run `./setup.sh` which will try to install all the necessary dependencies and build the front end for the first time. There should be no errors.
1. You should install Postgres, and get it running.  Make sure that `localhost` is specified as the `DATABASE_URL` in the config file.
1. Run `cd server/db; ./setupDb.sh` which will set up the database `wmfo_db` in Postgres.  BE AWARE that this will delete the `wmfo_db` database if it exists already, so be sure to *only* specify the db url as `localhost` unless you really know what you are doing.

## Running
1. Change into the `server/` directory with `cd server/`
1. Do `npm run dev`. If you have set everything up in the Installation section, you should be able to go to `localhost:5000` in your browser and see an example page.
